## 1. Ask
Task : In Chess, are there variations in opening popularity and success rates among different player ratings?

## 2. Prepare
Data Source: [High-Elo Games Chess Opening Dataset by MÖBIUS](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/chess-opening-dataset/)

Positive aspects of the dataset:
* Relevance: By focusing on games played by top-rated players, I am likely to capture high-level opening theory and strategies, which can be valuable for players interested in the latest developments in chess.
* Quality of Play: Strong players tend to play high-quality chess, and their games can provide insights into how strong opponents handle various openings in practice.

The dataset has limitations:
* Limited Sample Size: Filtering games to such specific rating ranges may reduce the size of your dataset significantly. Be mindful of potential limitations due to a smaller sample size, which could affect the statistical significance of your findings.
* The data is only till 2018 and there may have been new trends and improvements in opening theory.
